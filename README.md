## About Me  
I build open-source tools in **AI**, **Tokenization**, and **Bitcoin** — focusing on privacy, local-first workflows, and decentralized systems. I like to make things that are powerful, trustless, and easy to run on edge devices.

- 🔭 Current projects:  
  - **ai-research-hub** — collaborative AI experimentation hub  
  - **token-wallet-cli** — secure CLI wallet for managing tokens  
  - **btc-pay-tracker** — lightweight Bitcoin & Lightning Network tracker  
- 🌱 Learning: model version control, secure key storage, and decentralized protocols  
- 📫 Reach me: projokali@gmail.com  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m a Groot fan and like building things that “grow” in the open-source ecosystem
