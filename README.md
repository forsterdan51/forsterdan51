## About Me  
I build open-source tools in **AI**, **tokenization**, and **Bitcoin** — focusing on privacy, local-first workflows, and decentralized systems. I like to make things that are powerful, trustless, and easy to run on edge devices.

- 🔭 Current projects:  
  - **gpt-matchmaker** — AI account interaction matching system  
  - **edge-vision-ai** — on-device computer-vision inference engine  
- 🌱 Learning: model version control, secure key storage, and Lightning Network  
- 📫 Reach me: forsterdan51@gmail.com  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I treat my keyboard like a mini supercomputer
